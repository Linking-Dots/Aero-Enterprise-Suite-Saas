/* Test Authentication Theme Background Fix */

/* 
 * ISSUE: Authentication pages were not showing the theme background patterns
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE: 
 * - AuthLayout component was setting background: 'transparent' which overrode theme backgrounds
 * - Missing theme synchronization between auth pages and main app
 * - No specific CSS support for auth page background rendering
 * 
 * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
 * 
 * 1. UPDATED AuthLayout.jsx:
 *    - Removed background: 'transparent' override
 *    - Added useAuthThemeSync() hook for proper theme synchronization
 *    - Enhanced theme attribute application to document root
 * 
 * 2. CREATED useThemeSync.jsx hook:
 *    - Comprehensive theme synchronization across app and auth pages
 *    - Automatic background pattern application
 *    - Support for all theme settings (background, mode, colors, fonts)
 *    - Cross-tab theme change detection
 *    - Special auth page optimizations
 * 
 * 3. ENHANCED theme-transitions.css:
 *    - Added .auth-page-background class for better background rendering
 *    - Added .auth-background-overlay for improved form readability
 *    - Safari vendor prefix support for backdrop-filter
 *    - Dark mode support for auth overlays
 * 
 * VERIFICATION STEPS:
 * 1. Navigate to login page (/login)
 * 2. Background should match current theme pattern from ThemeSettingDrawer
 * 3. Change theme pattern in main app, then visit auth pages - should match
 * 4. Change theme mode (light/dark) - auth pages should reflect changes
 * 5. Test with different theme colors (ocean, sunset, forest, etc.)
 * 
 * TECHNICAL DETAILS:
 * - Theme background patterns are applied via [data-background] CSS selectors
 * - Document root attributes: data-background, data-theme-mode, data-theme, data-font
 * - localStorage keys: aero-hr-background, darkMode, selectedTheme, selectedFont
 * - CSS background patterns: pattern-glass-1 through pattern-glass-5
 * - Performance optimizations: will-change, transform triggers, requestAnimationFrame
 * 
 * FILES MODIFIED:
 * - resources/js/Components/AuthLayout.jsx (background override removed, theme sync added)
 * - resources/js/hooks/useThemeSync.jsx (new comprehensive theme hook)
 * - resources/css/theme-transitions.css (auth-specific background support)
