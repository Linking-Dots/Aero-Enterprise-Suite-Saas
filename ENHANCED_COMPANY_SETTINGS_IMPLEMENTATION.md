## 🚀 Testing Plan

### 1. Access the Enhanced Settings
- Navigate to `/company-settings/enhanced`
- Verify both "Company Information" and "Brand Assets" tabs load
- Check that existing company data is displayed

### 2. Test Logo Upload
- Upload different logo variants (SVG, PNG, JPG)
- Verify file validation works for invalid files
- Test the drag-and-drop functionality
- Verify preview generation

### 3. Test Logo Management
- Delete uploaded logos
- View logo history
- Test favicon preview functionality

### 4. Test Integration
- Refresh the page and verify loading screen shows company logo
- Check if favicon updates in browser tab
- Verify shared props contain company data

### 5. Test Security
- Upload malicious SVG files (should be sanitized)
- Try uploading oversized files (should be rejected)
- Test unauthorized access (should be blocked)

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Missing Dependencies
The implementation uses some packages that may need installation:
```bash
# If using image processing (currently commented out)
composer require intervention/image

# For React dropzone (if not already installed)
npm install react-dropzone
```

### Configuration Requirements
- Ensure `storage/app/public` is linked: `php artisan storage:link`
- Set proper file permissions for upload directory
- Configure max upload size in PHP and server

### Next Steps
1. **Install missing dependencies** if needed
2. **Run the migration** to create database tables
3. **Test the upload functionality** with various file types
4. **Integrate CompanyLogo component** into existing Header
5. **Add CDN integration** for production (future enhancement)

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness
- All components are designed with mobile-first approach
- Responsive grid layouts for logo management
- Touch-friendly upload areas
- Optimized modals for small screens

## ♿ Accessibility Features
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Alt text management for all logos
- Screen reader friendly error messages

## 🎯 Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for logo history
- Image optimization (placeholder for future enhancement)
- Efficient file storage structure
- Minimal database queries through eager loading

This implementation provides a solid foundation for enterprise-level brand management while maintaining security, performance, and user experience standards.
