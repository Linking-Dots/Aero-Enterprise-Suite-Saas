4. ✅ Real-time Session Tracking
5. ✅ Device Fingerprinting
6. ✅ Geographic Anomaly Detection
7. ✅ Multiple Session Monitoring
```

### 📝 **Registration Process Enhancement**
**Before:** Basic user creation
**After:** Security-first user onboarding

```php
// Enhanced Registration Flow:
1. ✅ Registration Rate Limiting
2. ✅ User Creation with Security Defaults
3. ✅ Security Event Logging
4. ✅ Initial Session Tracking
5. ✅ Device Recognition & Fingerprinting
```

### 🔑 **Password Reset Enhancement**
**Before:** Standard Laravel password reset
**After:** Comprehensive audit trail with security monitoring

```php
// Enhanced Password Reset Flow:
1. ✅ Reset Attempt Rate Limiting

## 🔄 **AUTHENTICATION FLOW COMPARISON**

### **BEFORE (Basic Laravel Auth):**
```
Login → Authenticate → Redirect
Register → Create User → Login
Reset → Validate Token → Update Password
```

### **AFTER (Enhanced Security System):**
```
🔐 LOGIN:
Rate Check → Auth → Security Log → Session Track → Device Fingerprint → Anomaly Detect

📝 REGISTER:
Rate Check → User Create (Security Defaults) → Security Log → Session Track

🔑 RESET:
Rate Check → Audit Log → Token Validate → Security Log → Reset Track
```
