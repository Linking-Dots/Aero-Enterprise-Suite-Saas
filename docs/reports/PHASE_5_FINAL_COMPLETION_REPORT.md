- **Impact**: Fixed Core Web Vitals monitoring in production
- **New Feature**: Added INP (Interaction to Next Paint) metric support

### **Performance Testing Infrastructure** 🧪
- **Infrastructure**: Complete Playwright-based performance testing suite
- **Coverage**: Dashboard load time, Core Web Vitals, bundle size analysis
- **Results**: Baseline performance measurement established
- **CI/CD**: Automated performance quality gates implemented

### **Production Monitoring** 📈
- **Real-time Metrics**: 6 Core Web Vitals metrics (FCP, LCP, FID, INP, CLS, TTFB)
- **Performance Dashboard**: Live monitoring with rating system
- **Alerting**: Critical performance issue detection
- **Baseline**: Performance comparison and regression detection
