# Leave Management System Updates

## Overview
Updated the Aero-HR system's leave management to align with the new Spatie-compliant permission and role system. The system now uses industry-standard admin leave management UI while maintaining consistency between admin and employee views.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Updates

#### 1. LeavesAdmin.jsx (`resources/js/Pages/LeavesAdmin.jsx`)
- **Updated UI**: Modern glass-morphism design consistent with employee view
- **Industry-standard admin features**:
  - Quick stats dashboard (pending, approved, rejected, total)
  - Tab-based filtering (All Leaves, Pending Approval, Approved, Rejected)
  - Advanced filters (employee search, month/year, status, leave type)
  - Bulk actions (approve/reject multiple leaves)
  - Export functionality
- **Permission-based access**: Uses new permission system (`leaves.view`, `leaves.create`, `leaves.approve`, etc.)
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly with adaptive UI components

#### 2. LeaveEmployeeTable.jsx (`resources/js/Tables/LeaveEmployeeTable.jsx`)
- **Shared component**: Both admin and employee views use the same table component
- **Permission-based logic**: Replaced role-based checks with permission-based access control
- **Admin-specific features**:
  - Bulk selection (checkboxes for admin view)
  - Bulk action toolbar (approve/reject selected)
  - Employee column (shows employee info in admin view)
  - Enhanced actions (edit/delete with permission checks)
- **Status management**: Quick status update dropdown for admin users
- **Mobile optimization**: Responsive cards for mobile devices

### Backend Updates

#### 3. LeaveController.php (`app/Http/Controllers/LeaveController.php`)
- **New methods**:
  - `bulkApprove()`: Approve multiple leaves at once
  - `bulkReject()`: Reject multiple leaves at once
- **Enhanced pagination**: Now returns statistics data for admin dashboard
- **Permission validation**: Bulk operations protected by `leaves.approve` permission

#### 4. LeaveQueryService.php (`app/Services/Leave/LeaveQueryService.php`)
- **Permission-based filtering**: Uses `$user->can('leaves.view')` instead of role checks
- **New statistics method**: `getLeaveStatistics()` for admin dashboard metrics
- **Improved filtering**: Better date and employee filtering for admin vs employee views
- **Admin/employee data separation**: Proper data scoping based on permissions

#### 5. Routes (`routes/web.php`)
- **New bulk operation routes**:
  - `POST /leaves/bulk-approve` (protected by `leaves.approve` permission)
  - `POST /leaves/bulk-reject` (protected by `leaves.approve` permission)

## Features

### Admin View Features
1. **Dashboard Statistics**: Real-time counts of pending, approved, rejected, and total leaves
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Search by employee, filter by month/year, status, and leave type
3. **Tab Navigation**: Quick access to different leave categories
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select and approve/reject multiple leaves simultaneously
5. **Employee Management**: View and manage leaves for all employees
6. **Status Updates**: Quick status changes with dropdown actions
7. **Export Functionality**: Export leave data (UI ready, backend can be implemented)

### Employee View Features (Maintained)
1. **Personal Leave History**: View own leave requests
2. **Leave Balance Summary**: View remaining leave days by type
3. **Leave Type Cards**: Visual display of available leave types
4. **Year-based filtering**: Filter leaves by year
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

## Permission System Integration

### Required Permissions
- `leaves.view`: View all employee leaves (admin)
- `leaves.create`: Create new leave requests
- `leaves.update`: Edit existing leave requests
- `leaves.delete`: Delete leave requests
- `leaves.approve`: Approve/reject leave requests and bulk operations
- `leave.own.view`: View own leave requests (employee)

### Permission Usage
- **Admin View**: Requires `leaves.view` permission
- **Employee View**: Uses `leave.own.view` permission
- **Bulk Operations**: Protected by `leaves.approve` permission
- **Individual Actions**: Each action (create, edit, delete) uses respective permissions

## UI Consistency

### Design Principles
1. **Shared Components**: Same table component used for both views
2. **Glass-morphism**: Consistent backdrop-blur and transparency effects
3. **Color Scheme**: Unified color palette with gradient accents
4. **Typography**: Consistent font weights and sizes
5. **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach

### Component Reusability
- `LeaveEmployeeTable`: Shared between admin and employee views
- `GlassCard`: Consistent card component
- `LeaveForm`: Shared form component for create/edit
- `DeleteLeaveForm`: Shared delete confirmation

## No Breaking Changes

### Backward Compatibility
1. **API Endpoints**: All existing endpoints maintained
2. **Data Structure**: No changes to database schema
3. **Component Props**: Backward compatible prop interfaces
4. **Employee Functionality**: All employee features preserved

### Safe Migration
1. **Permission Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of missing permissions
2. **Role Compatibility**: Works with existing role assignments
3. **Data Integrity**: No data loss during permission migration

## Testing Recommendations

### Frontend Testing
1. **Admin View**: Test all filters, bulk operations, and permissions
2. **Employee View**: Verify all existing functionality works
3. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. **Permission Checks**: Test with different user permission sets

### Backend Testing
1. **Bulk Operations**: Test with multiple leave selections
2. **Permission Middleware**: Verify route protection
3. **Data Filtering**: Test admin vs employee data scoping
4. **Statistics**: Verify dashboard metrics accuracy

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Email Notifications**: Auto-notify on status changes
2. **Leave Calendar**: Visual calendar view of leaves
3. **Reporting**: Advanced leave reports and analytics
4. **Approval Workflow**: Multi-level approval process
5. **Leave Policies**: Configurable leave policies per department

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites

2. **User Role Assignment**: Assign appropriate roles to users
3. **Cache Clearing**: Clear application cache after deployment
4. **Asset Compilation**: Rebuild frontend assets

### Verification Steps
1. **Admin Access**: Verify admin users can access leave management
2. **Employee Access**: Confirm employees can view their leaves
3. **Bulk Operations**: Test bulk approve/reject functionality
4. **Statistics**: Verify dashboard statistics display correctly
5. **Responsive Design**: Test on various screen sizes
