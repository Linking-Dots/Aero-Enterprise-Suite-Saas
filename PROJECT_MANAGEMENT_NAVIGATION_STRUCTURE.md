# Project Management Module - Navigation Structure

## Overview
The Project Management module in Aero-HR ERP has been designed with a comprehensive navigation structure that provides both global views and project-specific features.

## Navigation Structure

### Global Navigation (Main Menu)
These features are accessible from the main navigation menu:

1. **Dashboard** (`project-management.dashboard`)
   - Overview of all projects, statistics, and key metrics
   - Global project management insights

2. **Projects** (`project-management.projects.index`)
   - List of all projects
   - Create new projects
   - Each project card provides access to project-specific features

3. **Tasks** (`project-management.tasks.global`)
   - Global view of ALL tasks across ALL projects
   - Shows which project each task belongs to
   - Searchable and filterable

4. **Milestones** (`project-management.milestones.global`)
   - Global view of ALL milestones across ALL projects
   - Shows which project each milestone belongs to
   - Searchable and filterable

5. **Issues** (`project-management.issues.global`)
   - Global view of ALL issues across ALL projects
   - Shows which project each issue belongs to
   - Searchable and filterable

6. **Resources** (`project-management.resources.global`)
   - Global view of ALL resource allocations across ALL projects
   - Shows which project each resource is allocated to
   - Searchable and filterable

7. **Management Tools** (Global)
   - **Time Tracking** (`project-management.time-tracking.index`)
     - Global time tracking across all projects
     - Time reports and analytics
   - **Budgets** (`project-management.project-budgets.index`)
     - Global budget management across all projects
     - Budget reports and analytics
   - **Gantt Overview** (`project-management.gantt.index`)
     - Global Gantt chart view across projects

8. **Legacy** (Backward Compatibility)
   - **Worklog** (`daily-works`)
   - **Analytics** (`daily-works-summary`)

### Project-Specific Features
These features are accessible from individual project pages for project-specific context:

1. **Tasks** (`project-management.tasks.index`, requires `{project}` parameter)
   - Accessible from each project's card in the Projects listing
   - Manages tasks specific to that project

2. **Milestones** (`project-management.milestones.index`, requires `{project}` parameter)
   - Accessible from each project's card in the Projects listing
   - Manages milestones specific to that project

3. **Issues** (`project-management.issues.index`, requires `{project}` parameter)
   - Accessible from each project's card in the Projects listing
   - Manages issues specific to that project

4. **Resources** (`project-management.resources.index`, requires `{project}` parameter)
   - Accessible from each project's card in the Projects listing
   - Manages resources allocated to that specific project

## Route Structure

### Global Routes (No Project Parameter Required)
```php
// Dashboard
Route::get('/dashboard', [ProjectController::class, 'dashboard'])->name('dashboard');

// Projects
Route::get('/projects', [ProjectController::class, 'index'])->name('projects.index');
Route::get('/projects/create', [ProjectController::class, 'create'])->name('projects.create');

// Time Tracking (Global)
Route::get('/time-tracking', [TimeTrackingController::class, 'index'])->name('time-tracking.index');
Route::get('/time-tracking/reports', [TimeTrackingController::class, 'reports'])->name('time-tracking.reports');

// Budget (Global)
Route::get('/budgets', [BudgetController::class, 'index'])->name('project-budgets.index');
Route::get('/budgets/reports', [BudgetController::class, 'reports'])->name('project-budgets.reports');

// Gantt (Global)
Route::get('/gantt', [GanttController::class, 'index'])->name('gantt.index');
```

### Project-Specific Routes (Require Project Parameter)
```php
// Tasks
Route::get('/projects/{project}/tasks', [TaskController::class, 'index'])->name('tasks.index');

// Milestones
Route::get('/projects/{project}/milestones', [MilestoneController::class, 'index'])->name('milestones.index');

// Issues
Route::get('/projects/{project}/issues', [IssueController::class, 'index'])->name('issues.index');

// Resources
Route::get('/projects/{project}/resources', [ResourceController::class, 'index'])->name('resources.index');
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **User navigates to Projects from main menu**
   - Sees list of all projects
   - Each project card shows basic information (status, progress, budget, etc.)

2. **User clicks on project-specific actions**
   - From each project card, user can access:
     - Tasks (for that specific project)
     - Milestones (for that specific project)
     - Issues (for that specific project)
     - Resources (for that specific project)

3. **User accesses global tools**
   - Time Tracking: See time entries across all projects
   - Budgets: See budget allocation across all projects
   - Gantt Overview: See timeline view across all projects

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Logical Separation**: Global features vs. project-specific features
2. **Better UX**: Users don't get confused by features that need project context
3. **Cleaner Navigation**: Main menu is not cluttered with project-specific items
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add more projects without affecting navigation
5. **Error Prevention**: Prevents Ziggy routing errors from missing project parameters

## Implementation Status

✅ **Complete**: All features are implemented and working
✅ **Navigation**: Fixed navigation structure to prevent routing errors
✅ **User Interface**: Project cards provide clear access to project-specific features
✅ **Backend**: All controllers and routes are properly configured
✅ **Frontend**: All React components are implemented and functional

## Next Steps

- The Project Management module is now at 100% completion
- All submodules are properly implemented and accessible
- Navigation structure is logical and user-friendly
- Ready for production use
