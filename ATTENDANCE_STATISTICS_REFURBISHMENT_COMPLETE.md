### Work Time Analytics
1. **Average Work Hours**: Daily average based on total work time per day (handles multiple punches)
2. **Total Work Hours**: Cumulative work time for the month across all punches
3. **Overtime Hours**: Hours worked beyond standard 8-hour day (calculated per day, then summed)

### Leave Management
1. **Total Leave Days**: Sum of all leave types taken
2. **Leave Breakdown**: Categorized by leave type (Sick, Casual, etc.)

### Administrative Insights (Admin Only)
1. **Today's Snapshot**: Real-time present/absent/late counts (unique users only)
2. **Employee Distribution**: Percentage-based attendance rates
3. **Monthly Trends**: Historical performance indicators
